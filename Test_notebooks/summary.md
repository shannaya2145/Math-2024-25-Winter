# WELCOME to Mathematics 2024/25 Winter Semester

## First rule of our course is: We will be only using Jupyter files! 

Think of them as your notebook, calculator, whiteboard, and code editor all in one. You will submit your exercises **only through Jupyter files**.  We won't be using mouse paintings, bad hand written scans. 

Jupyter allows you to write and run code, organize text, and even include math formulas, pictures, and links. 

Master "What_is_Jupyter.ipynb" before the next class. We'll focus on exercises, not technical issues!

- You are old school handwrting person? Do your work by hand first, take a photo of your notes, and use ChatGPT to help convert PICTURE into markdown for your Jupyter file!

- Ask the AI chat to produce you what you want! Ask it for Latex, for code, for explanation, for definition! and then paste markdown to jupyter.

- You encounter an error in code? Copy the error message and ask Chat AI to resolve it for you!

- Translate the problem from English to your language! Talk with chat AI to give you for instance step by step solution in your language, and then translate it back to English in markdown format and paste it to Jupyter!

- Exam by lecturer will be done by hand. Jupyter is not for avoid doing work. It is only for oursource doing boring transitions, and to make your work more readable and understandable. You have to understand the problem, and solution, and be able to do it by hand! Then you simply will be telling Jupyter what to do, and it will do it for you (with some help of ChatGPT translating your thoughts to code/execution).

## Other rules

### Important: 

Your success in this course depends on consistent effort and participation. We strongly believe that the skills you develop here will be highly beneficial for your future studies and career. You must be willing to put in the work. We will be monitoring your progress and will provide feedback to help you improve. But remember, you are responsible for your own learning.

### Passing the lecture exam:

Details will be provided by the lecturer. However, you must achieve at least a grade of 3.0 in our exercises to be eligible to take the lecture exam.

### Passing exercises:

#### Tests

There will be three online tests (via MS Forms) at the end of each section, but your activity and participation are the most crucial elements. 

#### Everyweek work

I will regularly ask you to show your work. If you are not working or collaborating, I will mark you down for inactivity. Failing to engage will quickly result in failing the course. On the other hand, those who are active and committed will find it much easier to pass. I will take note of those who are helpful and contribute positively.

#### Do the exercises in advance

The classes are for presenting your work and not for you to "start learning material, or start typing some staff. You should solve problems on your own in advance to classes. You should  present your solutions to the class.

We will be spending time on classes for discussing possible issues, removing some minor obstacles you encountered, and showing improvements, to make your work and understanding better.

We won't have time to watch you typing letter by letter to start do deal with exercises. Provided Jupyter files will guide you through examples, and you’ll apply them to solve problems on your own.

#### Use ChatGPT intelligently! It is your friend!

Use the ChatGPT to help you with the exercises. Ask it for help, ask it for explanations, ask it for code, ask it for definitions, ask it what to do with the error message you encountered. In the past you would ask google, now it is way easier!

#### Critical requirements 

If you do not have a GitHub account with your copied Jupyter files within 2 weeks, you will fail the course. We need to move forward with exercises, and we cannot wait for those who are not serious about participating.

# Homework for the next class:

Do your own repository on GitHub. Fork the original repository to your account. Open the Jupyter files in Colab, and start working on the exercises. Make sure that you are able to save your work!

# Course original repository

Link to the original repository with stored course files: https://github.com/dchorazkiewicz/Math-2024-25-Winter

---

# Your own repository

**We will be working using colab Jupyters online!**

But **in contrast** to the first classes, you will be working on **your own GitHub repository**! After you will have github account, you will have to fork (fancy name for copying) the original repository to your own account:

1. Log in on interent browser to your GitHub account.
2. Go in the browser to the original repository https://github.com/dchorazkiewicz/Math-2024-25-Winter
3. Click on the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of the page.
4. Wait a moment, and you will be redirected to your own repository.
5. Copy the link to your repository (you will need it to open Jupyter notebooks in Colab), which will be of the form: https://github.com/YOUR_NAME/Math-2024-25-Winter
6. Visit Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/ and click on the "GitHub" tab.
7. Paste the link to your repository in the search bar and press enter.
8. You will see the list of files in your repository, and you can open them in Colab.
9. You can now work on the files, make changes, and save them in your repository.
10. Remember to save your work in your repository, so you can show it during the classes!

Ps. advanced users might use Visual Studio and run Jupyters locally.

### Working Environment Configuration

Create an account on GitHub (free!) -- required for participation and course completion. 

We recommend using your student email address (@student.vizja.pl, etc. so you can claim free github copilot (later).

Requiring problem: while setting account check spam box on https://poczta.vizja.pl/ or https://outlook.office.com/mail/!!!).

Get access https://colab.google/ -- required for participation and course completion.

An account on Google Colab or for advanced users, a local Python environment (e.g., Anaconda) -- required for participation and course completion.
